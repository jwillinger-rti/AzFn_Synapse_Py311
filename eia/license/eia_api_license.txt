Use
You may use the EIA API to develop a service to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view and otherwise "get" information from EIA data.

Attribution
You should use the "EIA" or the "U.S. Energy Information Administration" names in order to identify the source of API content subject to these rules. You may not use the EIA names, or the like to imply endorsement or approval of any product, service, or entity, not-for-profit, commercial or otherwise.  

EIA Logo
The EIA logo is trademarked and may not be used without written permission from the EIA.  This API agreement does not grant such permission.

Modification or False Representation of Content

If the EIA reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, your ability to use the API may be temporarily or permanently blocked. The EIA may monitor your use of the API to improve the service or to insure compliance with this Agreement.

Service Termination
If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of the API. The EIA reserves the right (though not the obligation) to: (1) refuse to provide the API to you, if it is the EIA's opinion that use violates any EIA policy; or, (2) terminate or deny you access to and use of all or part of the API at any time for any other reason in its sole discretion. All provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

Changes
The EIA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement, in whole or in part. Your continued use of or access to the API following posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those modified terms. The EIA may in the future, offer new services and/or features through the API. Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Disclaimer of Warranties
The API is provided "as is" and on an "as-available" basis. The EIA hereby disclaims all warranties of any kind, expressed or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The EIA makes no warranty that the API will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.

Limitations on Liability
In no event will the EIA be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (1) any special, incidental, or consequential damages; (2) the cost of procurement of substitute products or services; or (3) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data.

General Representations
You hereby warrant that:  (1) your use of the API will be in strict accordance with the EIA privacy policy, this Agreement, and all applicable laws and regulations; and (2) your use of the API will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the EIA, its contractors, employees, agents, and the like from and against any and all claims and expenses including attorney's fees, arising out of your use of the API, including but not limited to violation of this Agreement.

Miscellaneous
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the EIA and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by the posting of a revised version on this page by the EIA.

Disputes
Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the API shall be governed by federal law.

No Waiver Rights
The EIA's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute waiver of such right or provision.
